This is the body paragraph of the article that I am testing. I am going to keep writing for a minute to see if the formatting is ok. I would like to see how it turns out on mobile as well. This will be interesting. 

I am now doing a new **paragraph.**

Tabbing does not seem to be available.

1. Testing the numbering. 
2. Big and red... going to need to change that. 

`testing code -- oh cool`

Linking in another site: [Google](https://www.google.com/) is cool.
